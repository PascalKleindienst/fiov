## What is Fiov?

Fiov is a modern open-source application for financial management. It was developed to help you effortlessly track, analyze, and understand your income and expenses. With an intuitive user interface and data-driven insights, Fiov gives you back control over your financial situation. The protection of your data has the highest priority.

## Core Concepts

Fiov's functionality is based on some simple but powerful concepts:

- **[Accounts (Wallets)](/en/usage/wallets.md)**: Represent your real accounts such as checking accounts, credit cards, or cash holdings. Each account consolidates its own transactions.
- **[Categories](/en/usage/categories.md)**: Serve to organize your transactions. Using rules, transactions can even be automatically assigned to the correct category.
- **[Transactions](/en/usage/transactions.md)**: Map all your financial activities. Fiov supports both one-time and recurring transactions for subscriptions or salaries.
- **[Budgets](/en/usage/budgets.md)**: Set financial limits for specific categories and track their compliance to achieve your savings goals.
